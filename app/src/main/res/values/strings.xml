    <string name="cognitive">“Cognitive Minds” is a personality development society.

We aim at turning an individual into a person who is “socially likeable and personally confident”, who has a repute among his friends and family, who speaks clearly and expresses himself to the throng with panache, has a strong self-image and a good listening ability.
To add a zing, this automatically paves your way to phenomenal interview and GD experiences.

How do we do it?

One, to make one be able to make his own opinion on things and express it freely and firmly, we organise different forms of debates.
Two, to build up one’s spontaneity, we come up with extempores.
Most importantly, group discussions on general current and interesting topics so that one expresses himself freely among the multitude.
Story narrations to improve upon the monotony. A series of turncoats in a fun way to remove hesitancy.
